# Combat-Game
Oregon State University CS 162 Project in which a two player turn-based combat game was created. The user choose two teams of characters and the characters will battle until one of the teams runs out of characters.

This project was conceptually difficult because I have not yet had to deal with queues or linked lists that point to objects. It took time for me to fully understand the concept, and I ended up with a plan that dealt with up to three levels of pointers. Since I had two central classes (Game and Queue) I had to split the flow of the program between three programs. This was a bit chaotic at first, but I found that by laying out pseudo code and starting on the project I was able to work through the confusion and develop system that made sense to me.
